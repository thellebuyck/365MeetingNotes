# Backlog Grooming and Purposes


## Why do we do backlog grooming?

1. Provides a single source of truth for the team's planned work
1. Review the items and discuss how the items support the strategic objectives
1. Breakdown complex tasks into smaller actionable items
1. Discuss items on the list and clarify any issues or questions the team may have?
1. Keep it organized, up-to-date and healthy
1. Excise items that no longer are necessary or do not align with our objectives?

## Why do you need a healthy backlog?

The simple answer is that it makes it easier to assign work. The team can plan their work for a development cycle.  The functions are defined and ready for work and team can hand out items based on priority. 

## Backlog Refinement

1. Allows us to improve clarity and prevent misunderstanding by adding the fine grain details.
1. Identify Risks and obstacles for items close to implementation
1. This is where items are decomposed into smaller tasks.
1. It keeps the Product Backlog focused, clean, and relevant, so you won’t feel like you’re drowning in an ever growing to do list.
1. Gives us an opportunity to add new items or remove items that we thought were a good idea.

Question: What is Pythonpath?
Answer: A Pythonpath tells the Python interpreter to locate the module files that can be imported into the program. It includes the Python source library directory and source code directory.

Question: Can we preset Pythonpath?

Question: What are the supported standard data types in Python?
Answer: The supported standard data types in Python include the following.


Question: Why do we need a break in Python?
Answer: Break helps in controlling the Python loop by breaking the current loop from execution and transfer the control to the next block.

Question: Why do we need a continue in Python?
Answer: A continue also helps in controlling the Python loop but by making jumps to the next iteration of the loop without exhausting it.

Question: Can we use a break and continue together in Python? How?
Answer:  Break and continue can be used together in Python. The break will stop the current loop from execution, while jump will take to another loop.

Question: Does Python support an intrinsic do-while loop?
Answer: No Python does not support an intrinsic do-while loop.

Question: What are the different stages of the Life Cycle of a Thread?
Answer: The different stages of the Life Cycle of a Thread can be stated as follows.

Stage 1: Creating a class where we can override the run method of the Thread class.
Stage 2: We make a call to start() on the new thread. The thread is taken forward for scheduling purposes.
Stage 3: Execution takes place wherein the thread starts execution, and it reaches the running state.
Stage 4: Thread wait until the calls to methods including join() and sleep() takes place. 
Stage 5: After the waiting or execution of the thread, the waiting thread is sent for scheduling.
Stage 6: Running thread is done by executing the terminates and reaches the dead state.
Question: What is the purpose of relational operators in Python?
Answer: The purpose of relational operators in Python is to compare values.

Question: What are assignment operators in Python?
Answer: The assignment operators in Python can help in combining all the arithmetic operators with the assignment symbol.

Question: Why do we need membership operators in Python?
Answer:  We need membership operators in Python with the purpose to confirm if the value is a member in another or not.

Question: How are identity operators different than the membership operators?
Answer: Unlike membership operators, the identity operators compare the values to find out if they have the same value or not.

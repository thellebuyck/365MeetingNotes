18. What are the different types of classes in C#?
Sample answer:

There are generally considered to be four types of classes in C#. These include:

types of classes in C#
Abstract classes: These provide a common definition for a base class that other classes can be derived from
Static classes: These contain static items that can only interact with other static items
Partial classes: These are portions of a class that a compiler can combine to form a complete class
Sealed classes: These cannot be inherited by any class but can be instantiated
19. What is the difference between fields and properties in C#?
Sample answer:

A field is a member of a class or an object of any type that represents a location for storing a value, whereas a property is a class member that provides a mechanism to read, write, and compute the value of a private field.

20. What are circular references in C#?
Sample answer:

In C#, circular references occur when two or more interdependent resources refer back to each other, either directly or indirectly, resulting in a closed loop or lock condition. This situation makes the resource unusable.

21. What is meant by object pooling in C#?
Sample answer:

Object pooling is a software creational design pattern that recycles objects rather than recreating them. It does that by holding selected objects in a pool ready for use when they are requested by an application. 

This process helps to improve performance by minimizing unnecessary object creation. 

22. What are the different types of control statements in C#?
Sample answer:

There are generally considered to be three main types of control statements, each serving different purposes. These include:

Selection statements, which enable you to branch to different sections of code
Iteration statements, which enable you to loop through connections or perform the same series of operations repeatedly until a specified condition is met
Jump statements, which enable control of flow to be shifted to another section of code
23. What is method overloading in C#?
Sample answer:

In C#, method overloading is the process of assigning different signatures or arguments to two or more methods bearing the same name. It’s an example of polymorphism in object-oriented programming. 

Method overloading improves the readability of the program by reducing the number of names associated with a specific action.

24. What are boxing and unboxing in C#?
Sample answer:

In C#, boxing and unboxing allow developers to convert .NET data types from reference type to value type and vice versa. 

Unboxing is used to convert a reference type to a value type, while boxing is used to convert a value type to a reference type. These two processes underpin the unified view of C#.

25. What is the difference between ref and out keywords in C#?
Sample answer:

The <ref> and <out> keywords are similar in that they are both used to pass arguments in a reference or function. However, there is a subtle difference:

With <ref> keywords, the value is already set, meaning the method can read and modify it
With <out> keywords, the value isn’t set and can’t be read by the method until it is set, meaning the method must set it before it can be returned
26. How are extension methods used in C#?
Sample answer:

Extension methods allow developers to add a method to existing types without changing the original source code. This allows them to extend the functionality of the method. An extension method is a static method and uses the <this> keyword.

27. How are user controls created in C#?
Sample answer:

In C#, user controls allow developers to write code that can be used in various areas of the program. 

For example, if a website requires the same search control in multiple places, it can be created once as a user control and then dropped into different areas of the code. This serves the dual purposes of reusability and bug prevention.

28. When should nullable types be used in C#?
Sample answer:

In C#, nullable types are used to represent an undefined value of an underlying type. It essentially means ‘no value’ and is generally used when no data is available for the field.

29. How is serialization implemented in C#?
Sample answer:

In C#, serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes for storage on a memory, database, or file. This allows the developer to save the state of an object for future reference. 

Serialization can be performed by applying <SerializableAttribute> to a type to indicate that instances of this type can be serialized. All public and private fields marked as such are then serialized by default.

30. What is the difference between String and StringBuilder in C#?
Sample answer:

A string object is immutable, meaning that it cannot be changed after it’s created. Any operation that tries to modify the string object will simply create a new string object. On the other hand, a string builder object is mutable and can be modified as the developer sees fit.

31. How is reflection used in C#?
Sample answer:

In C#, reflection is used to obtain metadata on types at runtime. In other words, it allows developers to retrieve data on the loaded assemblies and the types within them.

It’s implemented using a two-step process. First, you get the type object. Second, you use the type to browse members, such as methods and properties. 

32. What are the advantages of generics in C#?
Sample answer:

In C#, generics allow the developer to define classes and methods which can be used with any data type. This brings several benefits:

Saves time by reusing code
Provides type safety without unnecessary overhead
Removes the need for boxing and unboxing
Generic collection types generally perform better with value types because there is no need to box the values
33. What are the disadvantages of generics in C#?
Sample answer:

There are a few limitations with generics. These include:

They cannot be used with enumerations
They cannot be used with lightweight dynamic methods
The .NET framework doesn’t support context-bound generic types
34. What are the key differences between Array and ArrayList in C#?
Sample answer:

An ArrayList has wider usage than an Array. The key differences include:

An Array is strongly-typed, meaning it only stores the same type of data. An ArrayList is a non-generic collection type, meaning it can store multiple types of data
An Array stores a fixed number of elements. An ArrayList features a variable number of elements and can continually be added to
An Array cannot accept null values, whereas an ArrayList can
The relative simplicity of an Array means it typically provides better performance than an ArrayList

35. How are the different types of control statements used in C#?
Sample answer:

Each type of control statement has its own set of syntax used to invoke the statement:

Selection statements include <if>, <else>, <switch>, and <case>
Iteration statements include <do>, <for>, <foreach>, and <while>
Jump statements include <break>, <continue>, <return>, and <goto>
36. When should multithreading be used and when should it be avoided in C#?
Sample answer:

Multithreading, or threading, can be a good way to improve the performance of a program where several operations run simultaneously. 

It allows distinct threads to run at their own time, rather than having to wait for the previous step to be complete. This has the potential to speed up a program.

However, multithreading is not advisable when much of the program’s processes are interdependent. For example, if Step B was reliant on the prior completion of Step A, multithreading would lead to performance issues and create bugs in the program. 

As a program grows more complex, threading becomes a more delicate operation. 

37. What is a multicast delegate in C#?
Sample answer:

Unlike a simple delegate, a multicast delegate in C# references multiple target methods. When a multicast delegate is used, all the functions the delegate is pointing to are invoked. They’re implemented using the MulticastDelegate class, which is derived from the system.

38. How would you explain the four fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming? 
Sample answer:

The four fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming can be explained as follows:

Encapsulation is the bundling of data, including the methods that operate on that data, into a single, private unit
Polymorphism is the ability of a type to take on many forms using a single interface
Abstraction is the concealment of unnecessary program details so that the user only sees the essential attributes
Inheritance is the process where one class derives (or inherits) its attributes and methods from another
39. How is the singleton design pattern implemented in C#?
Sample answer:

The singleton design pattern ensures that only one object of its kind exists, and provides global access to it for any other code. This design pattern can be implemented in a number of ways, using:

Thread-safety singleton
Thread-safety singleton using double-check locking
No thread-safe singleton
Thread-safe without a lock
.NET 4’s Lazy<T> type
40. What is the difference between late binding and early binding in C#?
Sample answer:

The key differences between early binding and late binding are:

Early binding occurs at compile-time, whereas late binding occurs at runtime
Early binding uses class information to resolve method calling, whereas late binding uses the object to resolve method calling
Typically, the performance of late binding is slower than early binding because it occurs at runtime
41. How is HashSet used in C#?
Sample answer:

In C#, HashSet is an unordered collection of distinct values. Generally, it is used to prevent duplicate elements from being placed in a collection, and it performs better than a list in achieving this goal. 

It is implemented using the HashSet class, which is derived from the System. 

42. When is method overriding used in C#?
Sample answer:

In C#, method overriding is used to invoke functions that belong to different classes. This process creates a method in the derived class with the same signature as a method in the base class without modifying the code of the base class. This helps achieve runtime polymorphism.

43. What is the difference between Const and ReadOnly keywords in C#?
Sample answer:

There are several differences between Const and ReadOnly keywords in C#. These include:

ReadOnly is a constant used at runtime, whereas Const is a constant used at compile-time
ReadOnly values can be changed, whereas Const values cannot be changed
ReadOnly cannot be declared inside the method, whereas Const can
44. How are custom controls added to an application in C#?
Sample answer:

A custom control is designed for single use in a specific application. There are three main ways to create a new custom control:

Derive it from an existing user control
Group existing controls together into new compiled control
Create a new control by deriving from the System.Windows.Controls.Control class
45. What is meant by dependency injection in C#?
Sample answer:

In C#, dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern used to develop loosely coupled code. This process moves the creation and binding of dependent objects outside of the class that depends on them. The main purpose of this is to make future changes to code more manageable. 

46. How can circular references be fixed in C#?
Sample answer:

In C#, circular references are most commonly resolved using garbage collection. The garbage collector systematically detects and collects circular references. Other solutions for circular references issues include callback methods, event handlers, and dependency injection.

47. How can a class be set to be inherited without overriding the method in C#?
Sample answer:

Provided that the method isn’t virtual, it won’t be overridden. However, if the class is inheriting from a base class that contains a virtual member function, you can use the <sealed> modifier to avoid further overriding that member function.

48. What are the different techniques for overloading a method in C#?
Sample answer:

Method overloading can be achieved in the three following ways:

By using different types of data for parameters in a method
By changing the number of parameters in a method
By changing the order of parameters in a method
49. How is exception handling performed in C#?
Sample answer:

In C#, exception handling helps detect errors in code at runtime. The process is implemented using four different keywords:

<Try> identifies blocks of code where exceptions are activated
<Catch> catches the exceptions that have been identified by <Try>
<Finally> executes a given set of statements depending on whether an exception is thrown out or not
<Throw> removes the exception
50. What is the difference between a throw exception and a throw clause in C#?
Sample answer:

The fundamental difference is that throw exceptions overwrite the stack trace, whereas throw clauses retain the stack information. As such, it is much harder to retrieve the original code responsible for throwing the exception with throw exceptions.

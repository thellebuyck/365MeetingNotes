# Meeting with Federico

These are my meeting notes with Federico

## Main Focus

- Mainly with Facilitation
  - Stand ups
  - Grooming is done every single day
  - follow up on items from the previous day/determine if there is additional capacity to do more work.
    - Used to do this on a sprint schedule but were running into roadblocks with the business because of additional requests from the business
  - Retros
  - Jira Administration
  - For dashboards/new fields/etc.
    - Planning
- Process Enhancement
  - Finding something different
  - Outstanding Items
        - Create a product road map for applications.
    - Transformation to Kanban
- Process Management
- Ensure that the dev team follows the process.
- Estimation & Analysis
  - gets an end date (How often to we hit the date)
- In Progress (currently being worked on)
- On Hold (Waiting on external resources)
- Code Review (mandatory)
- Ready For Demo
  - Demo Video created.
        - Have done live for awhile?
        - Business doesn't have time to attend for small features
        - Large Features
            - Create a session, the business must attend in a live session.
            - Requires the original stake holder, but not limited to the original requestor
  - If changes are needed
    - Send this back to development for Re-estimation and prioritization.
- UAT
  - While in UAT, the business can request additional features and changes (this is noted as a pain point).

- Limited access to people in the organization
- Not involved in estimation and requirements gathering
- He thinks that he's under utilized.
  - What more would you like to do?
    - Help more with requirements gathering and creating the whole planning.
      - Reporting with specific metrics that they would like to see?
            - Throughput (how much that is delivered per time period)
            - How do we measure success here?
            - Dashboards.
            - What like to setup communication with the business to show what is currently being worked on.
            - Improvement Possibilities
                - resource management
                - time management

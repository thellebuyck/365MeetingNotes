# Microsoft 365 Password Sync

## What is being done?

In order to synchronize passwords between your user accounts and Office 365, Safety Net will be performing maintenance and installing a utility to perform this function.  This is being done so that users do not have to maintain two passwords; one to login to a computer and the other to login in to Office to view email.

## What does this mean for you?

Once they install the utility and synchronize passwords, you will be required to enter your credentials on any device that is using Office 365.  These will be the same credentials that are used to login to your computer.  You will continue to manage your login credentials from your computer.  You will not be able to reset your password via Office 365.

## When will this be done?

This work will be performed this Wednesday (2/23/2022) at 8am.
